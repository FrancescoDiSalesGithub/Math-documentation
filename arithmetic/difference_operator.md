# Difference operator (-)

Given a number a , Difference operator removes a quantity given by number b. The result c used by the difference of the number a and the number b is called Difference.

`c = a - b`

if b = a then:

`c = a - a = 0`


### Examples:

given a=3 and b=2 then c will be:
` c = a - b = 3 - 2 = 3 - 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 `

## Difference in the Z field numbers

if a number a is less than a number b then the outcoume will have a negative number. That result is in the relative number field
