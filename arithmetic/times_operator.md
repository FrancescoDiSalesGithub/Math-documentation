# Times operator

Given a number a, the times operator sums the number a for the times of the number b.

```
c = a * b = a + a + ... + a 
            |______________|
            all for b times
```

# Multiplication table
A mnemonic table that can help to understand the times operator is the pitagorich table:

Each row is multiplied by its row


### Examples

a = 2 b = 3

` c = a * b = a + a + a = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`

a = 2 b = 8

` c = a * b = a + a + a + a + a + a + a + a   = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 + 2 + 2 = 14 +2 = 16   `

since a=b then we can go for another route: 

` c = a * b = a * a = a^2 `
