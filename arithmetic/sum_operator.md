# Sum operator (+)

Given a number a , Sum operator adds a quantity given by number b. The result c used by the sum of the number a and the number b is called sum.

`c = a + b`

if b = a then:

`c = a + a = 2a`


### Examples:

given a=2 and b=3 then c will be:
` c = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 `

given a=2 and b=a then c will be:
` c = a + a = 2 + 2 = 4 `

Another route:
`c = a + a = 2a = 2*(2) = 4`
